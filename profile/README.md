## Virginia Tech Course

**[CS 2104](https://github.com/Jerry-NotesHub/CS_2104_Note)**

- Course Summary: This course introduces the student to a broad range of heuristics for solving problems in a range of settings. Emphasis on problem-solving techniques that aid programmers and computer scientists. Heuristics for solving problems ''in the small'' (classical math and word problems), generating potential solutions to ''real-life'' problems encountered in the profession, and problem solving in teams.

[CS 2114](https://github.com/Jerry-NotesHub/CS_2114_Note)

- Course Summary: A programming-intensive exploration of software design concepts and implementation techniques. Builds on knowledge of fundamental object-oriented programming. Advanced object-oriented software design, algorithm development and analysis, and classic data structures. Includes a team-based, semester-long software project. (2H,3L,3C)

[CS 2505](https://github.com/Jerry-NotesHub/CS_2505_Note)

- Course Summary: An introduction to the design and operation of digital computers. Works up from the logic gate level to combinational and sequential circuits, information representation, computer arithmetic, arithmetic/logic units, control unit design, basic computer organization, relationships between high level programming languages and instruction set architectures. (3H, 3C)

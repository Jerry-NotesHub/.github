## Virginia Tech Course

**[CS 1114](https://github.com/Jerry-NotesHub/CS_1114_Note)**

- Course Summary: Fundamental concepts of programming from an object-oriented perspective. Basic software engineering principles and programming skills in a programming language that supports the object-oriented paradigm. Simple data types, control structures, array and string data structures, basic algorithms, testing and debugging. A basic model of the computer as an abstract machine. Modeling and problem-solving skills applicable to programming at this level. Partially duplicates CS 1054 and CS 1124. (2H,2L,3C)

**[CS 2104](https://github.com/Jerry-NotesHub/CS_2104_Note)**

- Course Summary: This course introduces the student to a broad range of heuristics for solving problems in a range of settings. Emphasis on problem-solving techniques that aid programmers and computer scientists. Heuristics for solving problems ''in the small'' (classical math and word problems), generating potential solutions to ''real-life'' problems encountered in the profession, and problem solving in teams.

**[CS 2114](https://github.com/Jerry-NotesHub/CS_2114_Note)**

- Course Summary: A programming-intensive exploration of software design concepts and implementation techniques. Builds on knowledge of fundamental object-oriented programming. Advanced object-oriented software design, algorithm development and analysis, and classic data structures. Includes a team-based, semester-long software project. (2H,3L,3C)

**[CS 2505](https://github.com/Jerry-NotesHub/CS_2505_Note)**

- Course Summary: An introduction to the design and operation of digital computers. Works up from the logic gate level to combinational and sequential circuits, information representation, computer arithmetic, arithmetic/logic units, control unit design, basic computer organization, relationships between high level programming languages and instruction set architectures. (3H, 3C)

**[CS 2506](https://github.com/Jerry-NotesHub/CS_2506_Note)**

- Course Summary: An introduction to the design and operation of digital computers. Instruction formats and construction, addressing modes, instruction execution, memory hierarchy operation and performance, pipelining, input/output, multiprocessors, and the relationships between high level programming languages and machine language. (3H, 3C)

**[CS 3114](https://github.com/Jerry-NotesHub/CS_3114_Note)**

- Course Summary: Advanced data structures and analysis of data structure and algorithm performance. Sorting, searching, hashing, and advanced tree structures and algorithms. File system organization and access methods. Course projects require advanced problem-solving, design, and implementation skills. (3H, 3C)

**[CS 3114](https://github.com/Jerry-NotesHub/CS_3114_Note)**

- Course Summary: Studies the ethical, social, and professional concerns of the computer science field. Covers the social impact of the computer, implications and effects of computers on society, and the responsibilities of computer professionals in directing the emerging technology. The topics are studied through case studies of reliable, risk-free technologies, and systems that provide user friendly processes. Specific studies are augmented by an overview of the history of computing, interaction with industrial partners and computing professionals, and attention to the legal and ethical responsibilities of professionals. This is a web-supported course, incorporating writing intensive exercises, making extensive use of active learning technologies.

**[CS 3704](https://github.com/Jerry-NotesHub/CS_3704_Note)**

- Course Summary: Explores the principles of software design in detail, with an emphasis on software engineering aspects. Includes exposure of software lifecycle activities including design, coding, testing, debugging, and maintenance, highlighting how design affects these activities. Peer reviews, designing for software reuse, CASE tools, and writing software to specifications are also covered.  (3H,3C)
